172,Paul George,23,Out,2026-03-25,"The suspension will start with Saturday's game against the Pelicans and will keep George off the floor until late March. In his absence, Dominick Barlow figures to be the top candidate to enter the 76ers' starting lineup, and Kelly Oubre should also take on an expanded role for Philadelphia."
145,Joel Embiid,23,Probable,2026-02-02,"Embiid is listed on the injury report due to right ankle injury management but carries a probable tag, signaling optimism he'll suit up Monday.
