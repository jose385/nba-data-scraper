490,Trae Young,30,Out,2026-02-19,"The Wizards are taking a cautious approach with their new acquisition as he deals with MCL and quadriceps injuries in his right knee. The timeline for a return likely means Young won't make his team debut for at least another month. With Young sidelined, Tre Johnson and Bub Carrington should continue to push for minutes near the 30s."
1028243921,N'Faly Dante,1,Out For Season,2027-01-01,"Dante made just four appearances at the NBA level in 2025-26, as he spent the bulk of his time with the College Park Skyhawks in the G League. In four appearances for the Skyhawks, Dante produced averages of 11.8 points, 5.8 rebounds and 2.2 assists."
434,Jayson Tatum,2,Out,2026-04-01,"Charania adds that the Celtics are ""cautiously optimistic"" about Tatum returning later in the season. Tatum himself is on record saying he isn't ruling out a return, and by all accounts, his rehab is going swimmingly. ""Clearly Jayson Tatum has a goal in his mind that he wants to play,"" Charania said. ""Whether he can get there by the time we're in February, March or April, we'll see."" How Boston performs this season is likely to factor into Tatum's decision as well, making this is an intriguing storyline to watch."
3092,Haywood Highsmith,3,Doubtful,2026-01-27,Highsmith remains without a timetable for a return due to right knee injury management. The forward still hasn't made his season debut and can be considered out indefinitely until the Nets provide another update on his recovery.
371,Mason Plumlee,4,Out,2026-02-19,"Plumlee had missed four consecutive games with a strained right groin before going under the knife. The veteran center will be sidelined until at least mid-February. While he's sidelined, PJ Hall will likely step into the third-string center role behind Ryan Kalkbrenner (elbow) and Moussa Diabate."
102,Zach Collins,5,Out,2026-02-19,"Collins suffered a significant right big toe sprain in late December, and he's not expected to shed his walking boot until late January or early February, at the earliest, per Johnson. Collins' absence has meant more minutes for Julian Phillips and Patrick Williams."
1057272081,Noa Essengue,5,Out For Season,2026-10-01,"The No. 12 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, Essengue's rookie season comes to an end with just two brief appearances to his name. The Bulls had a plan to bring him along slowly, to be clear, and he showed a lot of promise in four G League appearances with averages of 23.0 points, 8.5 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 1.0 steals and 1.3 three-pointers."
666908,Max Strus,6,Out,2026-02-19,"Strus hasn't yet made his season debut, and he needs even more time on the shelf to recover from offseason left foot surgery. It's unlikely the swingman will be ready to play until sometime in February at this point. In the meantime, Sam Merrill and Jaylon Tyson should continue helping fill out the minutes on the wing."
56677840,Dereck Lively II,7,Out For Season,2026-10-01,"Lively sought out multiple opinions on his right foot, but it was ultimately determined that season-ending surgery was the best course of action for the third-year center, and he's expected to make a full recovery ahead of the 2026-27 season. Daniel Gafford and Dwight Powell will continue to serve as the main big men for Dallas behind Anthony Davis in Lively's absence."
228,Kyrie Irving,7,Out,2026-02-12,"Irving tore the ACL in his left knee at the beginning of March, ending his 2024-25 campaign, but after undergoing surgery, the Mavericks said they were optimistic their superstar guard would return to action before 2026, per Shams Charania of ESPN. Before training camp this season, there was another positive update about Irving's recovery, with Ashish Mathur of the Dallas Hoops Journal reporting that the veteran was ahead of schedule in his recovery. However, a few days later, head coach Jason Kidd pumped the brakes, saying Irving is doing ""quite well"" but added that declaring he was ""ahead of schedule is not fair,"" per Christian Clark of The Athletic. It's clear that Irving and the Mavericks don't want to pick a target date until they are absolutely certain he's ready for game action, but Afseth notes that the vibe around the organization is that Irving could return before the mid-February All-Star break. ""I've personally liked, from my understanding of the situation, have long held the thought that there's optimism of a pre-All-Star break return. But that's not ever been like super like that's happening, there hasn't been a set guarantee like anything of that nature,"" Afseth concluded. NBA insider Marc J. Spears also relayed a promising update on Irving in mid-November, ""Kyrie's looking good. He's ahead of schedule,"" Spears said. ""He's working out with the purpose of playing this season, which I'm sure Mavs fans are glad to hear. I think, optimistic-wise, around late-January, All-Star break. Someone close to him told me that if it was the playoffs, he could play right now. That's how ahead of schedule he is."" Despite all the optimism, fantasy managers are going to be left in the dark for at least a few more weeks before we learn anything definitive. Irving has been spotted doing light, individual drills at recent practices and is spending a lot of time mentoring Cooper Flagg."
151,Dante Exum,7,Out For Season,2026-10-01,"Exum needs a follow-up procedure after dealing with complications from offseason right knee surgery, which will keep him sidelined for the remainder of the year. The veteran guard will be an unrestricted free agent next summer. Until Kyrie Irving (knee) is cleared to play, D'Angelo Russell and Brandon Williams should continue to share the minutes at point guard."
246,Nikola Jokic,8,Out,2026-02-01,"Jokic, who was initially given a four-week re-evaluation timeline, is ""right on schedule, if not a little ahead of schedule,"" Charania said. If he can return around late January or early February, that would allow him to be eligible for the NBA's awards, such as the All-NBA Teams and MVP race."
666679,Cameron Johnson,8,Doubtful,2026-01-27,"Johnson is still recovering from a bone bruise in his right knee and hasn't played since Dec. 23. The 29-year-old forward was initially given a re-evaluation timetable of four to six weeks, though it appears likely he'll be re-evaluated closer to the back end of that timeline. He should be considered week-to-week until the Nuggets offer an update on his progress."
1057844839,Tamar Bates,8,Out,,Foot
458,Fred VanVleet,11,Out,2026-06-01,"VanVleet struggled with efficiency during his second season in Houston, but the Rockets' win-loss record with him on the court (41-19) spoke volumes about his overall impact on the team. With VanVleet sidelined, the runway is clear for Reed Sheppard, who barely had a role as a rookie. Amen Thompson could also handle a ton of ball-handling responsibilities, while Aaron Holiday is the only other true point guard on the roster currently."
3547243,Obi Toppin,12,Out,2026-02-02,"Toppin will likely miss a considerable amount of time following this surgery. Head coach Rick Carlisle told the media not to ask about Toppin's status until Feb. 1. The team will likely turn to Jay Huff, Jarace Walker and Tony Bradley to help shoulder the load in the frontcourt."
3547245,Tyrese Haliburton,12,Out For Season,2026-10-01,"Haliburton tore his right Achilles in Game 7 of the NBA Finals on June 22 and underwent surgery the following day. Any hope of a return during the 2025-26 campaign was shut down Monday, when Pacers president Kevin Pritchard stated plainly, ""He will not play next year though. We would not jeopardize that now. So don't get any hopes up that he will play."" Haliburton has cemented himself as the face of the franchise and played a key role in Indiana's run to the NBA Finals during the 2024-25 playoffs, averaging 17.3 points, 8.6 assists, 5.3 rebounds and 1.3 steals in 33.5 minutes across 23 postseason games. During the 2024-25 regular season, the 2020 first-round pick averaged 18.6 points, 9.2 assists, 3.5 rebounds and 1.4 steals over 73 appearances."
53,Bogdan Bogdanovic,13,Doubtful,2026-01-27,"Bogdanovic hasn't played since Dec. 26, and the Clippers have not released any updates on him making meaningful progress in his recovery from the hamstring issue. Bogdanovic should be considered week-to-week moving forward."
247,Derrick Jones Jr.,13,Out,2026-02-06,"Shams Charania of ESPN previously reported that Jones would be re-evaluated in about six weeks after he sustained a Grade 2 MCL sprain of his right knee in a Jan. 3 loss to the Celtics, but the fact that the veteran forward is practicing in some capacity less than a month later suggesting he's progressing much more quickly than anticipated. Given that Jones previously missed 17 straight games earlier this season due to an MCL sprain of the same knee, the Clippers are likely to proceed cautiously with bringing him back. That said, if Jones experiences no setbacks in his next handful of practices, he looks like he could have a chance at returning to action before the All-Star break."
37,Bradley Beal,13,Out For Season,2026-10-01,"This is a devastating blow for Beal and the Clippers. The official diagnosis is a fractured left hip, and an exact timetable has yet to be announced. Beal signed a two-year, $11 million deal with the Clippers prior to the season, and the second year of his deal includes a player option which he may be likely to pick up with this news. With Beal out for the season, the Clippers could lean pretty heavily on Kris Dunn. Guys like Bogdan Bogdanovic and Chris Paul could reemerge too, but they've been afterthoughts in the rotation for the most part."
1057386376,Adou Thiero,14,Out,2026-02-02,"Thierro missed the beginning of the season with a left knee issue, so this is not related to that. Thiero will be re-evaluated in four weeks, but it's likely he misses the whole month of January. Thiero has just 15 NBA appearances to his name this season."
17553995,Austin Reaves,14,Out,2026-01-28,"Reaves has progressed enough in his recovery from a left calf strain to engage in full-contact work in practice. He's not quite ready to return to the Lakers' lineup, and his next opportunity to do so is Wednesday against the Cavaliers."
666505,Brandon Clarke,15,Out,2026-02-20,"Based on this timetable, a return right after the All-Star break could potentially be on the table for Clarke. The forward has appeared in just two games this season, as he was dealing with a knee issue prior to his latest calf injury."
1028025754,Zach Edey,15,Out,2026-03-04,"After Edey initially sustained the injury Dec. 11, the Grizzlies relayed that the second-year center would be shut down for at least four weeks before being re-evaluated. Despite having spent the past month rehabbing the injury, Edey seemingly hasn't taken any major steps forward in his recovery and will now need another six weeks to let his ankle heal up. As a result of this latest update, Edey appears unlikely to be ready to return to game action until at least early March, making it tough to justify rostering him in most redraft formats. With Brandon Clarke (calf) also facing a long-term absence, Jock Landale should continue to hold down the fort as the Grizzlies' starting center."
666676,Ty Jerome,15,Out,2026-01-30,"After inking a two-year, $18 million deal with Memphis in the offseason, Jerome has yet to make his Grizzlies debut while he works his way back from the high-grade right calf strain he sustained late in the preseason. According to Damichael Cole of The Memphis Commercial Appeal, Iisalo said that Jerome has resumed taking part in 5-on-5 work in practices, and assuming the veteran guard experiences no setbacks while building up over the next week or two, he'll get the green light to play in games. With the Grizzlies announcing Saturday that Ja Morant (elbow) will be out at least three weeks before being re-evaluated, Jerome could be called upon to handle a prominent role in the Memphis backcourt right away upon gaining clearance."
38017656,Scotty Pippen Jr.,15,Out,2026-02-20,"Pippen has yet to appear in a game this season, and his debut will likely have to wait at least another month as he recovers from surgery. With Ty Jerome (calf) and Ja Morant (calf) also sidelined, the Grizzlies will rely on Cam Spencer and Javon Small to fill out the point guard minutes in the meantime."
403,Terry Rozier,16,Out,2026-02-20,"Rozier was arrested Thursday morning as part of an FBI sports betting gambling probe, and the NBA is acting quickly while this investigation gets underway. As of now, there is no known timetable for a potential return for Rozier, as this could be a lengthy process."
383,Taurean Prince,17,Out,2026-02-20,"Milwaukee labeled Prince as out indefinitely after he underwent surgery Nov. 13 to address a herniated disc in his neck. Approximately six weeks later, the Bucks haven't yet offered a more official timeline for Prince's return, but the team's decision to apply for a DPE implies that he's effectively being viewed as out for the season. Ultimately, an NBA-designated physician would need to concur with the Bucks' assessment that Prince is unlikely to return before June 15 in order for Milwaukee to be granted a DPE, which would enable to the team to sign a player to a one-year deal worth about $1.7 million -- half of Prince's salary -- or less. Before being shut down after undergoing surgery, Prince had appeared in the Bucks' first eight games of the season and averaged 6.1 points, 1.6 rebounds, 1.5 three-pointers, 1.0 assists and 0.8 steals in 21.0 minutes per contest."
1028028501,Terrence Shannon Jr.,18,Out,2026-01-26,Shannon is still recovering from a left foot abductor hallucis strain and is without a clear timetable for a return to action. The second-year swingman should be considered week-to-week until the Timberwolves offer an update on his progress.
334,Dejounte Murray,19,Out,2026-02-20,"For his part, Murray -- who underwent surgery Feb. 5, 2025 to address his torn right Achilles tendon -- hasn't provided an update since the Pelicans' media availability day back in September regarding where he stands in his rehab program. The 29-year-old hasn't necessarily hit any snags in his recovery, but Borrego noted that he couldn't ""say for sure"" that Murray will play any point in 2025-26 until the Pelicans get a chance to evaluate him live on the court during practices or scrimmages. At the very least, Borrego's comment about the Pelicans hoping to have more clarity on Murray's status in the next month would seem to indicate that New Orleans isn't counting on Murray making it back before the All-Star break in mid-February. In the meantime, rookie first-round pick Jeremiah Fears will continue to serve as the Pelicans' starting point guard amid Murray's absence."
201,Isaiah Hartenstein,21,Doubtful,2026-01-27,"Hartenstein will miss a 15th consecutive game due to a strained right calf, and a timeline for his return has yet to be established. His absence has allowed Jaylin Williams and Kenrich Williams to see a bump in playing time."
1028028932,Nikola Topic,21,Out,,Groin
1057274983,Thomas Sorber,21,Out For Season,,Knee
56677738,Colin Castleton,22,Out,2026-01-28,"Castleton will occupy Orlando's final two-way slot and will provide emergency depth for the team in the 2025-26 campaign. The 25-year-old big man appeared in 26 regular-season games (four starts) between the Grizzlies, 76ers and Raptors in 2024-25, averaging 4.7 points and 4.7 rebounds in 16.6 minutes per contest."
666923,Matisse Thybulle,25,Out,2026-02-01,"Thybulle underwent thumb surgery in late October to repair a torn UCL, and he's also dealing with right knee tendinopathy. The 28-year-old swingman remains without a timetable for a return and should be considered week-to-week until Portland offers an update on his progress."
56677747,Scoot Henderson,25,Out,2026-02-01,Henderson is still recovering from a torn left hamstring he sustained in September and has yet to make his season debut. He should be considered week-to-week until the Trail Blazers offer an update on his progress.
38017693,Blake Wesley,25,Out,2026-01-30,"A fifth metatarsal fracture is a notoriously tough injury to recover from, and there's a high chance of experiencing a setback if brought back too soon, so it wouldn't be shocking to see his absence extend beyond this 12-week window. At minimum, he'll be out through the end of December, so he can safely remain on the waiver wire in fantasy leagues."
278,Damian Lillard,25,Out For Season,2026-10-01,"Lillard underwent surgery on a torn Achilles tendon in his left foot over the summer after suffering the injury during the first round of the NBA playoffs with the Bucks against the Pacers. The veteran guard was then waived by Milwaukee on July 1, making him an unrestricted free agent. The future Hall of Famer then decided to return to the Blazers on a three-year contract worth $42 million with a player option for the 2027-28 season. He also has a no-trade clause in his deal."
38017688,Keegan Murray,26,Out,2026-02-04,"Murray suffered a left ankle sprain in Sunday's loss to the Bucks, and he could need to sit out as long as four weeks with the injury. The timetable for a return is likely to keep him out until late January or early February. With Murray sidelined, the likes of Precious Achiuwa, Nique Clifford and Keon Ellis will all have an opportunity to pick up the slack."
1057846535,Chucky Hepburn,28,Out,2026-02-19,"Hepburn is nearly averaging a double-double across 11 appearances with 12.8 points, 9.2 assists and 1.9 rebounds. He's also been sound defensively with 2.4 steals per contest."
373,Jakob Poeltl,28,Out,2026-02-08,"Poeltl was managing a lingering back injury for the opening portion of the 2025-26 regular season, but he aggravated the issue against the Nets on Dec. 21 and hasn't played since. Rookie first-rounder Collin Murray-Boyles (thumb) and Sandro Mamukelashvili will continue to operate in expanded roles for as long as Poeltl is sidelined."
344,Georges Niang,29,Doubtful,2026-01-27,"Niang has no timetable for his season debut, as he continues to recover from a fourth metatarsal stress reaction in his left foot. That said, fantasy managers can label him as week-to-week going forward."
38017705,Walker Kessler,29,Out For Season,2026-10-01,This is a devastating blow for the Jazz and for Kessler's fantasy managers given his high price in drafts.
56677831,Cam Whitmore,30,Out For Season,2026-10-01,"A ""venous condition"" is any disorder that affects the veins, but we'll likely have more clarity on precisely what Whitmore is dealing with at a later date. Whitmore will end his 2025-26 season with averages of 9.2 points and 2.8 rebounds per game on 46/29/74 shooting splits."
114,Seth Curry,10,Out,2026-02-03,"Curry hasn't been available since early December while recovering from left sciatic nerve irritation, and though he was scheduled to be re-evaluated this weekend, the Warriors haven't provided a clear update regarding where he stands in his recovery. The veteran guard will remain sidelined for the front end of a back-to-back set in Minnesota and appears unlikely to be available at any point during the Warriors' upcoming three-game week."
367,Chris Paul,13,Out,,Coach's Decision
38017715,Josh Minott,2,Questionable,2026-01-26,"Minott has not played since Jan. 3 due to a left ankle sprain. He has a chance to make his return Monday, though he wasn't a regular part of the Celtics' rotation prior to his injury."
56677791,Kris Murray,25,Out,2026-02-01,Murray will miss his 10th consecutive contest due to a back strain and remains without a clear timetable for a return. He can be considered week-to-week until Portland provides an update on his progress.
117,Anthony Davis,7,Out,2026-03-01,"Early indications were that Davis would go under the knife and miss multiple months. However, a second opinion was enough to convince Davis to rehab without a procedure. Still, he'll be sidelined for at least six weeks. meaning he likely won't be back until at least early March. Daniel Gafford, Dwight Powell and Moussa Cisse will handle center duties while Davis is sidelined."
1028264794,Elijah Harkless,29,Out,2026-01-28,"Harkless played a season-high 21 minutes, sliding into the rotation for just the third time this season. While he did provide some nice energy on the defensive end, there is no indication that Harkless will be moving into a more permanent role anytime soon."
378,Kristaps Porzingis,1,Out,2026-02-03,"Porzingis has missed the past eight games for Atlanta, but he's been cleared for basketball activities and is likely to return in the near future. Based on this re-evaluation date, a return Feb. 3 against the Heat could be on the table."
1028028244,Zaccharie Risacher,1,Out,2026-01-28,"Risacher will miss his ninth game in a row against Indiana due to a left knee bone contusion, but he's trending in the right direction after a rehab assignment in the G League. A return against the Celtics on Wednesday could be on the table, though it's worth mentioning that it's the first leg of a back-to-back set."
38017709,Christian Braun,8,Doubtful,2026-01-27,"Braun will miss an eighth straight game due to a sprained ankle, and it doesn't appear as though he is closing in on a return. His absence has allowed Jalen Pickett to enter the starting lineup."
297,Lauri Markkanen,29,Questionable,2026-01-27,"Markkanen will miss a seventh consecutive game while recovering from an illness, though recently he has been listed on the injury report as ""return-to-competition conditioning."" His next opportunity to play is Tuesday against the Clippers. Kyle Anderson, Cody Williams and Kyle Filipowski will continue to see more minutes in Markkanen's absence."
3547299,Sam Merrill,6,Out,2026-01-28,"The sharpshooter had missed six consecutive contests due to a right hand sprain, though it remains unclear if he's overcome the injury. With De'Andre Hunter (knee) questionable, Craig Porter and Dean Wade are candidates to soak up extra minutes Monday."
666581,Darius Garland,6,Out,2026-01-28,"This is a big blow for the Cavs, who will be without Garland for at least the next five games and likely longer. The point guard reportedly suffered the injury Jan. 14 against Philly and has already missed one game as a result of the injury. Craig Porter and Jaylon Tyson should be in line for more opportunities until Garland can return."
56677844,Bilal Coulibaly,30,Questionable,2026-01-27,"This is not a good sign for Coulibaly, as he's getting ruled out a day in advance -- he was carrying a questionable tag prior to Thursday's game versus Denver. With Coulibaly out for a fifth straight game, the Wizards could turn to Will Riley, Jusitn Champagnie and Jamir Watkins to soak up some minutes."
1016384149,Tristan Vukcevic,30,Questionable,2026-01-27,"With Marvin Bagley (back) also out again, the Wizards will likely deploy smaller lineups when Alex Sarr is not on the floor. That could mean more minutes for Will Riley, Justin Champagnie and Jamir Watkins."
666633,Tyler Herro,16,Doubtful,2026-01-28,"The Heat have yet to release a timetable, but the earliest possible return for Herro is set at Jan. 28 for the time being. With this news, the Heat are likely to lean more on Norman Powell and Jaime Jacquez for the short term, as well as Pelle Larsson and Nikola Jovic."
38017703,Jalen Williams,21,Out,2026-02-03,"This is a brutal blow for the Thunder and for Williams' fantasy managers. Williams is battling a right hamstring strain, and those tend to linger if not treated properly. Based on this re-evaluation timeline, the earliest possible return for Williams would be Feb. 3 against the Magic. In the meantime, players such as Cason Wallace, Isaiah Joe, Aaron Wiggins, Alex Caruso and Kenrich Williams could be a bit more involved for the Thunder."
3,Steven Adams,11,Out,2026-03-16,"Adams sustained the ankle injury in Sunday's win over the Pelicans, and Udoka added that the Rockets are still gathering more information. With the veteran big man expected to miss an extended period, Clint Capela will likely see an uptick in playing time behind Alperen Sengun. In 32 regular-season appearances (11 starts) thus far, Adams has averaged 5.8 points and 8.6 rebounds across 22.8 minutes per tilt."
1057268940,Collin Murray-Boyles,28,Questionable,2026-01-28,"Murray-Boyles will end up missing a fourth consecutive game due to a left thumb injury that he aggravated during the Raptors' loss to the Lakers on Jan. 18, and his next opportunity to play is Wednesday against the Knicks. Sandro Mamukelashvili should remain in Toronto's starting lineup in Murray-Boyles' absence."
89,Alex Caruso,21,Questionable,2026-01-27,"Sunday will mark Caruso's third consecutive game on the inactive list, and it's not a great sign that he continues to get ruled out 24 hours in advance of tipoff. Cason Wallace, Isaiah Joe and Luguentz Dort will be asked to help fill the void in Caruso's absence."
79,Jimmy Butler,10,Out For Season,2026-12-01,"The injury appeared severe and forced Butler to be removed from the game. Butler's absence is a difficult blow for the Warriors. Expect more minutes for Buddy Hield, Moses Moody, and Gary Payton. Butler's injury could also maybe force the return of Jonathan Kuminga to coach Steve Kerr's rotation."
1028038474,K.J. Simpson,4,Out,2026-01-28,"Simpson will miss a fourth consecutive game due to a left hip strain. He hasn't been part of the Hornets' rotation as of late, but his next opportunity to play is Wednesday against the Grizzlies."
1028029127,Kel'el Ware,16,Doubtful,2026-01-28,"Ware is set to miss his fourth consecutive contest Sunday, and his next opportunity to play will come at home against the Magic on Wednesday. With the second-year big man sidelined, Nikola Jovic will likely see increased playing time behind Bam Adebayo."
666849,Kevin Porter Jr.,17,Out,2026-02-03,"It appears that Porter is looking at a multi-game absence with this oblique injury, which should open up some minutes for Gary Trent, Gary Harris and Cole Anthony. Porter offers too much upside to cut, so managers should just tuck him away in an injury reserve spot."
17896067,Santi Aldama,15,Questionable,2026-01-26,"Aldama, who has missed the past three games for Memphis, remains day-to-day. If the big man is unable to suit up Monday, the Grizzlies will likely continue to lean on John Konchar, GG Jackson and Vince Williams."
277,Caris LeVert,9,Questionable,2026-01-27,"As expected, LeVert will miss a third consecutive game while battling through an illness, and his next opportunity to play is Tuesday against the Nuggets. Jaden Ivey and Marcus Sasser should continue to see more minutes off the bench in LeVert's absence."
1028245237,David Jones,27,Questionable,2026-01-28,"Jones Garcia isn't a regular in the Spurs' rotation, and Thursday's game was the first time he recorded double-digit minutes this season. Jones Garcia can put up decent numbers when given the chance, but due to his lack of involvement across the board, he shouldn't carry a lot of fantasy upside."
24,Marvin Bagley III,30,Questionable,2026-01-27,"Bagley missed Thursday's loss to Denver with an illness but is now dealing with a different problem. With Tristan Vukcevic (hamstring) out for Saturday, the Wizards could need Will Riley and Justin Champagnie to help pick up some center minutes in small-ball lineups behind Alex Sarr."
213,Aaron Holiday,11,Probable,2026-01-26,"Holiday will likely return to the lineup Monday after missing the last five games with a back issue. Holiday has seen inconsistent minutes this season, but with the team relatively healthy, he doesn't figure to return to a significant role."
1028037477,Ajay Mitchell,21,Questionable,2026-01-27,"Mitchell will miss his second straight game with an abdominal strain, and for now, he should be considered questionable for Tuesday's meeting with the Pelicans. Mitchell's minutes will likely be divvied up amongst Isaiah Joe, Luguentz Dort and Cason Wallace."
17896026,Franz Wagner,22,Out,2026-01-28,"Wagner missed Orlando's last two games with left ankle soreness and will miss a third consecutive contest due to injury management. The star forward was able to play in both of the Magic's games in Europe following a 16-game absence due to a left high-ankle sprain, and it appears the Magic are now erring on the side of caution. Wagner's next opportunity to play will come Wednesday against the Heat."
17553994,Davion Mitchell,16,Questionable,2026-01-28,"Mitchell will miss his third straight outing due to a left shoulder sprain, and his next opportunity to suit up will come Wednesday against the Magic. Kasparas Jakucionis and Dru Smith are candidates for increased playing time due to Mitchell being sidelined."
666786,Ja Morant,15,Out,2026-02-20,"Morant sustained a UCL sprain in his left elbow in the Jan. 21 game against the Hawks, and while he's expected to make a full recovery, he'll be re-evaluated in approximately three weeks. This means Morant won't return to action until probably after the All-Star break, impacting his potential trade value ahead of the Feb. 5 deadline. With Morant on the sidelines, the Grizzlies should turn to Cam Spencer and Vince Williams, although Ty Jerome (calf) should also see minutes at the point once he's fully healthy and ready to play."
17553979,Jonathan Kuminga,10,Out,2026-02-09,"Kuminga exited Thursday's loss to Dallas in the second quarter and was unable to return due to left knee soreness. He is now expected to miss an extended period. Until the Warriors offer a timetable for his return, the 23-year-old forward can be considered week-to-week. With Kuminga joining Jimmy Butler (knee) on the shelf, Gui Santos, Buddy Hield and Gary Payton are candidates for increased playing time."
3547242,Deni Avdija,25,Questionable,2026-01-26,"Avdija is in danger of missing a second consecutive contest due to a lower back strain he sustained in Thursday's win over the Heat. If the 25-year-old forward is ultimately ruled out, Sidy Cissoko and Rayan Rupert would be candidates for increased minutes."
455,Jonas Valanciunas,8,Questionable,2026-01-27,"Valanciunas returned from an 11-game layoff in a win over the Wizards on Thursday, but then hit the sidelines for Friday's win in Milwaukee, with that game coming as the second leg of a back-to-back set. If he needs to miss Sunday's game in Memphis, that would indicate he suffered a setback, but we'll have a better idea on Valanciunas' status following shootaround."
476,Robert Williams III,25,Questionable,2026-01-26,"Williams has missed two of Portland's last three games while managing a left knee injury but could be available for Monday's contest against the team that selected him in the first round of the 2018 NBA Draft. If Williams is unable to play, then Yang Hansen would serve as the top backup big man behind Donovan Clingan."
56677854,Chris Livingston,6,Questionable,2026-01-30,"After being waived by the Bucks during training camp, Livingston has latched on with another team. The 2023 second-rounder will likely see most of his playing time come with the G League's Cleveland Charge, though Livingston is also a depth option in the Cavaliers' frontcourt while Jarrett Allen's (finger) status remains in limbo."
38017721,Peyton Watson,8,Questionable,2026-01-27,"Watson is dealing with injuries to both of his ankles, which prevented him from playing in Friday's win against the Bucks. Julian Strawther would likely remain in the Nuggets' starting lineup if Watson is not cleared to return Sunday."
38017733,A.J. Green,17,Questionable,2026-01-27,"Green missed Friday's game due to illness, and he's still not recovered from the sickness. The 26-year-old guard's absence allowed for Gary Harris to draw a start, and Harris would likely remain in the first unit if Green can't play Sunday."
335,Jamal Murray,8,Questionable,2026-01-27,The NBA has yet to announce when the game will be played. Murray was listed as questionable for the contest due to injuries to his right hamstring and left hip.
3089,Gary Trent Jr.,17,Probable,2026-01-27,"An illness forced Trent to the sidelines for Friday's loss to the Nuggets, but it appears Trent will return Sunday evening. That said, Trent has been an inconsistent part of the Bucks' rotation as of late, so his playing status won't impact fantasy leagues."
56783340,Duop Reath,25,Out,2026-01-27,"Reath will miss a third straight game due to right foot soreness, and his next opportunity to play is Tuesday against the Wizards. Robert Williams (knee) and Yang Hansen will serve as the backup options at center behind Donovan Clingan in Reath's absence."
3547274,Tre Jones,5,Doubtful,2026-01-26,"Jones suffered a left hamstring strain and is ruled doubtful to play against the Lakers, but is set to be re-evaluated in two weeks and will likely not appear in a game until then. Ayo Dosunmu and Kevin Huerter are candidates to inherit Jones' minutes in the meantime."
1028026717,AJ Johnson,30,Questionable,2026-01-27,"Johnson was available to play Thursday against the Nuggets despite his illness, but he never saw the floor. He remains miles off the fantasy radar."
315,Khris Middleton,30,Questionable,2026-01-27,"Middleton will sit out of Saturday's contest while recovering from a left foot injury, and his next opportunity to play is Tuesday against the Trail Blazers. Justin Champagnie will likely enter the Wizards' starting lineup, and Will Riley could see an increase in minutes in Middleton's absence."
1057845382,Moussa Cisse,7,Questionable,2026-01-28,"Cisse is trending toward missing a second consecutive game while battling through an illness. His absence Sunday would leave Dwight Powell as the lone backup big man behind Daniel Gafford. Cisse has averaged 7.0 points, 8.2 rebounds and 1.8 blocks over 16.8 minutes per game over his last six outings."
285,Kevin Love,29,Questionable,2026-01-27,"The knee issue is a new concern for the veteran big man, and his next opportunity to play will come Tuesday against the Clippers. With Jusuf Nurkic (illness) expected to join Love on the sidelines, Kyle Filipowski and Kyle Anderson are candidates for increased playing time."
17895966,Jalen Green,24,Questionable,2026-01-27,"Green appeared to aggravate a right hamstring injury during the Suns' loss to the Hawks on Friday. It's the same injury that has limited the fifth-year pro to just four regular-season games, and Sunday will officially mark his 42nd missed game of the 2025-26 campaign. Grayson Allen and Collin Gillespie are the top candidates to start in the frontcourt for the Suns due to the absences of Green and Devin Booker (ankle)."
57,Devin Booker,24,Out,2026-02-01,"Booker sustained the injury during the third quarter of Friday's loss and was spotted with crutches following the game. He was already ruled out for Sunday's game against the Heat and looks to be out of action for at least the coming week, with a possible return taking place in early February. Collin Gillespie, Grayson Allen and Jordan Goodwin are in line for expanded roles for as long as Booker is sidelined."
177,Aaron Gordon,8,Doubtful,2026-01-27,"Gordon exited Friday's win over Milwaukee after aggravating his right hamstring injury, and now he'll miss Sunday's matchup with Memphis. Peyton Watson (ankle) is questionable for Sunday's game, and if he's forced to join Gordon on the sidelines, that would open up a ton of opportunity for Zeke Nnaji and Julian Strawther. For now, Gordon should be considered doubtful for Tuesday's game versus Detroit."
15,Giannis Antetokounmpo,17,Out,2026-02-20,"""He did a very good job. MRI has revealed exactly what we thought,"" Rivers said of Antetokounmpo's comments about likely missing four-to-six weeks. ""There's no timetable. Calf strain and really no timetable for return. Hopefully, like it was before, sooner (than later), but there's no timetable."""
1028026060,KyShawn George,30,Questionable,2026-01-27,"George checked out at the 11:35 mark of the fourth quarter and went to the locker room to have his ankle evaluated by medical staff. He returned to the bench but did not check back into the game, so his ankle injury could put him in jeopardy of missing Tuesday's game against the Trail Blazers."
56677843,Noah Clowney,3,Questionable,2026-01-27,"As expected, Clowney will not play in Sunday's game while managing a back injury, and his next opportunity to take the court is Tuesday against the Suns. Jalen Wilson, Ziaire Williams and Danny Wolf are all candidates to see increased playing time in Clowney's absence."
666656,De'Andre Hunter,6,Questionable,2026-01-26,"Hunter is still dealing with right knee soreness and might miss a second consecutive contest. If the 28-year-old forward remains sidelined, Nae'Qwan Tomlin and Jaylon Tyson would be candidates to see an uptick in minutes."
17896048,Cam Thomas,3,Questionable,2026-01-27,"Thomas has picked up a sprained ankle recently, and the issue will prevent him from appearing in Sunday's contest. The 24-year-old guard has been ice cold from the field recently, averaging 5.8 points on 21.2 percent shooting across 21.0 minutes over his last four games. Nolan Traore (illness) is also out, so look for Terance Mann and Ben Saraf to see more playing time. Thomas's next chance to play will come Tuesday at Phoenix."
1057275262,Nolan Traoré,3,Questionable,2026-01-27,"Traore is feeling under the weather, and he'll be unavailable for Sunday's matchup with the Clippers. Cam Thomas (ankle) is also out, so Ben Saraf, Tyrese Martin and Terance Martin will handle most of the reserve guard minutes. Traore's next chance to play will come Tuesday at Phoenix."
268,Zach LaVine,26,Questionable,2026-01-27,"LaVine popped up on Saturday night's injury report as questionable due to low back soreness. The Kings will hold the veteran wing out of Sunday's contest, and his next opportunity to play is Tuesday against the Knicks. Malik Monk, Dennis Schroder, Keon Ellis and Nique Clifford are candidates to enter Sacramento's starting lineup in LaVine's absence."
1028267470,Luke Travers,6,Questionable,2026-01-30,"After missing time due to a hamstring injury, the two-way player returned to the court with several Cleveland players sidelined, including Donovan Mitchell (illness). Travers has appeared in just 12 regular-season games for the parent club thus far and will likely continue spending plenty of time with the G League's Cleveland Charge."
38017676,MarJon Beauchamp,23,Questionable,2026-01-30,"Beauchamp will add depth on the wing and has plenty of NBA experience after his previous stints with the Bucks, Clippers and Knicks. He hasn't played in the NBA since the 2024-25 campaign, where he logged 35 total appearances for the three aforementioned teams and averaged 2.3 points on 4.5 minutes per game."
38017697,Max Christie,7,Questionable,2026-01-28,"Christie may have picked up the injury during the Mavericks' 116-110 loss to the Lakers on Saturday, when he tallied 24 points, three assists, two rebounds and one steal over 35 minutes. Cooper Flagg (ankle) is listed as doubtful, so Jaden Hardy, Ryan Nembhard and D'Angelo Russell would be in line for even larger roles if Christie is unable to play Sunday."
1057262088,Cooper Flagg,7,Questionable,2026-01-28,"The NBA has yet to offer an official word on a new date for this contest, though a make-up date of Feb. 19 is under consideration, per Mike Curtis of The Dallas Morning News. Flagg was listed as doubtful for Sunday's game due to left ankle injury management, and the Mavericks are next set to play against the Timberwolves on Wednesday."
443,Klay Thompson,7,Questionable,2026-01-28,"Thompson is trending toward missing his first game since Dec. 23 after playing just 14 minutes during Saturday's 116-110 loss to the Lakers, when he tallied six points (2-5 FG, 2-5 3Pt, 0-2 FT), three rebounds, one assist and two steals. Jaden Hardy and Caleb Martin should both see an uptick in playing time Sunday, assuming Thompson is ruled out."
24489167,Brandon Williams,7,Questionable,2026-01-28,"Williams may have tweaked his knee during the Mavericks' 116-110 loss to the Lakers on Saturday, when he recorded 20 points, four rebounds and four assists over 23 minutes off the bench. Williams would likely take on an expanded role if available Sunday due to Cooper Flagg (ankle) and Klay Thompson (knee) both being listed as doubtful."
17553967,Neemias Queta,2,Questionable,2026-01-26,"Queta has been battling through an illness as of late, which led to him being removed from the Celtics' starting lineup for Saturday's game against the Bulls, during which he played 24 minutes and logged six points (2-6 FG, 0-1 3Pt, 2-2 FT), three rebounds, two steals and one block. Rookie second-rounder Amari Williams would be slated to start for a second consecutive game if Queta is unable to play or is limited to a reserve role."
145,Joel Embiid,23,Out,2026-01-27,"Embiid will miss the front end of this back-to-back set as the 76ers continue to manage his availability. The star big man has yet to play in both halves of a back-to-back this season, though he'll likely return to action against the Bucks on Tuesday. With Embiid unavailable Monday, Andre Drummond is expected to get the starting nod, while Adem Bona should see an uptick in minutes as well."
172,Paul George,23,Out,2026-01-27,"George will miss the front end of this back-to-back set, and the veteran forward has yet to suit up in both legs of a back-to-back so far this season. His next opportunity to play will come Tuesday against Milwaukee. Dominick Barlow and Trendon Watford are candidates to see increased minutes due to George being sidelined, while Justin Edwards and Jabari Walker could enter the Philadelphia rotation."
38017691,TyTy Washington Jr.,13,Questionable,2026-01-27,Washington was a late addition to the injury report due to right hamstring soreness and won't be available Sunday. His next opportunity to suit up will come Tuesday against the Jazz.
56677833,Cason Wallace,21,Questionable,2026-01-27,"Wallace logged 16 minutes in the first half but won't play in the second due to the groin issue. He'll finish with three points (1-3 FG, 0-2 3Pt, 1-2 FT), one rebound and one assist. The 22-year-old guard's next opportunity to play will come Tuesday against the Pelicans."
139,Kris Dunn,13,Questionable,2026-01-27,"Dunn exited the game in the second quarter after appearing to tweak his right ankle. Although he did not return, he was sitting with the team on the bench for the second half, which could be a good sign for his status moving forward. He concludes the game with two points (1-3 FG), three rebounds and a steal in 12 minutes. Kobe Sanders is a candidate for extra minutes if Dunn is forced to miss time."
219,Al Horford,10,Out,2026-01-28,"Horford does not play in back-to-back sets, so he will take a maintenance day after logging 23 minutes Sunday. With Draymond Green (back) questionable, the Warriors could lean more on Gui Santos, Buddy Hield and Quinten Post."
313,De'Anthony Melton,10,Out,2026-01-28,"Melton popped up on the injury report due to left knee injury management, but he will be available for Sunday's game that was postponed from Saturday. He scored 22 points in 23 minutes during the Warriors' 123-115 loss to the Mavericks on Thursday, which was Golden State's second game without Jimmy Butler (knee -- ACL)."
17895854,Charles Bassey,15,Out,,Not Injury Related
17896056,Luka Garza,2,Questionable,2026-01-26,"Garza was a late addition to the injury report, presumably after waking up under the weather. He's played a minor role in recent weeks with 17.3 minutes per contest over his last seven games. The Celtics could lean on some small-ball lineups if the center is unable to go."
115,Stephen Curry,10,Questionable,2026-01-26,"The Warriors appear to be considering giving Curry the night off Monday, the second half of the team's back-to-back. If the superstar guard ends up sitting out, Will Richard and Pat Spencer could both be in line to play a featured role in the Golden State backcourt."
185,Draymond Green,10,Questionable,2026-01-26,"Green logged 23 minutes on the front end of this back-to-back set Sunday night, but he had a quiet showing with two points to his name. If he's given the night off for maintenance, the Warriors could turn to guys like Gui Santos and Quinten Post."
19465326,Jock Landale,15,Out,2026-01-28,"Landale has played a big role in recent outings, averaging 28.1 minutes per night over his last four games. Santi Aldama (knee) is questionable, so the Grizzlies could deploy some smaller lineup combinations with guys like GG Jackson and John Konchar picking up some extra minutes."
1057968644,LJ Cryer,10,Questionable,2026-01-26,"Cryer has totaled eight minutes over three appearances for the Warriors this season. That said, his possible absence doesn't appear to shake up the Golden State rotation Monday."
56677782,Leonard Miller,18,Questionable,2026-01-26,"Miller hasn't seen double-digit minutes since Jan. 4. As a result, his potential absence shouldn't have a noticeable impact on the Minnesota frontcourt rotation Monday."
